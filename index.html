    <h1>Welcome to the true dark mode!</h1>
    <p>Hello, darkness, my old friend<br>
        I've come to talk with you again<br>
        Because a vision softly creeping<br>
        Left its seeds while I was sleeping<br>
        And the vision that was planted in my brain<br>
        Still remains
        Within the sound of silence</p>
